# Final

What is your main idea and goals of the project each week?
Create an app/visual display/digital control through mobile phone for the hardware used for the fish tank controls. 

Who are you working with?
Myself. 

What problem are you trying to solve and how will code help?
Trying to automate the sensor check and the data from all the sensors that are being used to keep an eye on the levels of the tank. 

Does your project contain a dataset? How is it structured and used in your app?
Does not have a dataset, has parameters and can the data be recorded to create one? Can the data be recorded, streamed from the sensors, etc from the tank?

How do you plan on getting this done?
What tools, programming languages, hardware etc. do you need?
- A hub/central location to hold all sensors.
- A digital layout, (on my phone?) to display information.
- Sensors for temperature, chemical levels, water levels,
temperature.
- Wiring compatible with water.
- Water reserves and containers.
- Processing? 

What technical challenges do you expect.
The bringing of everything together. 

What help do you you need? (teachers, classmates or the internet)
A place to get started. And bringing it all together help.
